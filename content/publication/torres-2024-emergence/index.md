abstract: Multi-state metastability in neuroimaging signals reflects the braintextquoterights
  flexibility to transition between network configurations in response to changing
  environments or tasks. We modeled these dynamics with a Kuramoto network of 90 nodes
  oscillating at an intrinsic frequency of 40 Hz, interconnected using human brain
  structural connectivity strengths and delays. We simulated this model for 30 min
  to generate multi-state metastability. We identified global coupling and delay parameters
  that maximize spectral entropy, a proxy for multi-state metastability. At this operational
  point, multiple frequency-specific coherent sub-networks spontaneously emerge across
  oscillatory modes, persisting for periods between 140 and 4300 ms, reflecting flexible
  and sustained dynamic states. The topography of these sub-networks aligns with empirical
  resting-state neuroimaging data. Additionally, periodic components of the EEG spectra
  from young healthy participants correlate with maximal multi-state metastability,
  while dynamics away from this point correlate with sleep and anesthesia spectra.
  Our findings suggest that multi-state metastable functional dynamics observed in
  empirical data emerge from specific interactions of structural topography and connection
  delays, providing a platform to study mechanisms underlying flexible dynamics of
  cognition.
