abstract: The amplitude of auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) generated in the
  brainstem of rats exponentially decreases over the sequential averaging of EEG epochs.
  This behavior is partially due to the adaptation of the ASSR induced by the continuous
  and monotonous stimulation. In this study, we analyzed the potential clinical relevance
  of the ASSR adaptation. ASSR were elicited in eight anesthetized adult rats by 8-kHz
  tones, modulated in amplitude at 115 Hz. We called independent epochs to those EEG
  epochs acquired with sufficiently long inter-stimulus interval, so the ASSR contained
  in any given epoch is not affected by the previous stimulation. We tested whether
  the detection of ASSRs is improved when the response is computed by averaging independent
  EEG epochs, containing only unadapted auditory responses. The improvements in the
  ASSR detection obtained with standard, weighted and sorted averaging were compared.
  In the absence of artifacts, when the ASSR was elicited by continuous acoustic stimulation,
  the computation of the ASSR amplitude relied upon the averaging method. While the
  adaptive behavior of the ASSR was still evident after the weighting of epochs, the
  sorted averaging resulted in under-estimations of the ASSR amplitude. In the absence
  of artifacts, the ASSR amplitudes computed by averaging independent epochs did not
  depend on the averaging procedure. Averaging independent epochs resulted in higher
  ASSR amplitudes and halved the number of EEG epochs needed to be acquired to achieve
  the maximum detection rate of the ASSR. Acquisition protocols based on averaging
  independent EEG epochs, in combination with appropriate averaging methods for artifact
  reduction might contribute to develop more accurate hearing assessments based on
  ASSRs.
