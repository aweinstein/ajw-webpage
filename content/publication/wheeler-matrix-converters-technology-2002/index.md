abstract: The matrix converter is an array of controlled semiconductor switches that
  connects directly the three-phase source to the three-phase load. This converter
  has several attractive features that have been investigated in the last two decades.
  In the last few years, an increase in research work has been observed, bringing
  this topology closer to the industrial application. This paper presents the state-of-the-art
  view in the development of this converter, starting with a brief historical review.
  An important part of the paper is dedicated to a discussion of the most important
  modulation and control strategies developed recently. Special attention is given
  to present modern methods developed to solve the commutation problem. Some new arrays
  of power bidirectional switches integrated in a single module are also presented.
  Finally, this paper includes some practical issues related to the practical application
  of this technology, like overvoltage protection, use of filters and ride-through
  capability
