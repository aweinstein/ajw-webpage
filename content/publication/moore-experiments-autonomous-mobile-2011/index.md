abstract: Tunnels are a challenging environment for radio communications. In this
  paper we consider the use of autonomous mobile radio nodes (AMRs) to provide wireless
  tethering between a base station and a leader in a tunnel exploration scenario.
  We propose a tethering algorithm for AMR motion control based on a consensus variable
  protocol. Using radio signal strength measurements, the AMRs autonomously space
  themselves so as to achieve equal radio distance between each entity in the chain
  from the base station to the leader. Experimental results show the feasibility of
  our ideas.
