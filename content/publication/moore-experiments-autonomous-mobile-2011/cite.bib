 abstract = {Tunnels are a challenging environment for radio communications. In this paper we consider the use of autonomous mobile radio nodes (AMRs) to provide wireless tethering between a base station and a leader in a tunnel exploration scenario. We propose a tethering algorithm for AMR motion control based on a consensus variable protocol. Using radio signal strength measurements, the AMRs autonomously space themselves so as to achieve equal radio distance between each entity in the chain from the base station to the leader. Experimental results show the feasibility of our ideas.},
