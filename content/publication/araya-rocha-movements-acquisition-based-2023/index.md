abstract: The Leap Motion Controller (LMC) is a hand-held, non-professional motion
  capture device that is able to evaluate different motor tasks in a clinical setting.
  In this study, its accuracy was verified, evaluating its performance in the acquisition
  of movements based on the simulation of the Archimedean spiral test. We present
  an innovative method for obtaining information on fine motor skills during the spiral
  drawing test, using an instrumented evaluation platform based on the LMC. First,
  several experimental conditions were carried out that challenged the performance
  of the LMC during the simulation of the spiral test, then a case study was conducted
  to establish the validity of its use to evaluate the spiral drawing test in humans.
  Due to this research it is possible to extrapolate the spiral drawing test from
  a two-dimensional space to a three-dimensional space, without restrictions, or contact
  with objects and in a controlled clinical environment. Allowing to obtain variables
  of the kinematics of the hand during a spiral drawing task in a three-dimensional
  space in future.
