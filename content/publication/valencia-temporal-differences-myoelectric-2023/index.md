abstract: Forefoot (FF) and rearfoot (RF) running techniques can induce different
  lower-limb muscle activation patterns. However, few studies have evaluated temporal
  changes in the electromyographic activity (EMG) of lower limb muscles during running.
  The aim of this study was to compare temporal changes in EMG amplitude between RF
  and FF running techniques. Eleven recreational runners ran on a treadmill at a self-selected
  speed, once using a RF strike pattern and once using a FF strike pattern (randomized
  order). The EMG of five lower limb muscles [rectus femoris (RFe), biceps femoris
  (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), medial and lateral gastrocnemius (MG and LG)] was
  evaluated, using bipolar electrodes. EMG data from the RF and FF running techniques
  was then processed and compared with statistical parametric mapping (SPM), dividing
  the analysis of the running cycle into stance and swing phases. The MG and LG muscles
  showed higher activation during FF running at the beginning of the stance phase
  and at the end of the swing phase. During the end of the swing phase, the TA muscle's
  EMG amplitude was higher, when the RF running technique was used. A higher level
  of co-activation between the gastrocnemius and TA muscles was observed in both stance
  and swing phases using RF. The myoelectric behaviour of the RFe and BF muscles was
  similar during both running techniques. The current findings highlight that the
  two running techniques predominately reflect adjustments of the shank and not the
  thigh muscles, in both phases of the running cycle. HighlightsStatistical parametric
  mapping (SPM) can reveal temporal differences in muscle activity between running
  techniques.The medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles were more active at specific
  time-instants of the initial stance and late swing phases during forefoot (FF) running
  compared to rearfoot (RF) running.Higher activation was observed for the tibialis
  anterior muscle at the end of the swing phase during RF runningContrary to the muscle
  activity differences observed in the leg muscles, the muscle activity of the thigh
  muscles was similar during RF and FF running.
