abstract: The neurocomputational model textquoteleftDirections into Velocities of
  Articulatorstextquoteright (DIVA) was developed to account for various aspects of
  normal and disordered speech production and acquisition. The neural substrates of
  DIVA were established through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), providing
  physiological validation of the model. This study introduces DIVA_EEG an extension
  of DIVA that utilizes electroencephalography (EEG) to leverage the high temporal
  resolution and broad availability of EEG over fMRI. For the development of DIVA_EEG,
  EEG-like signals were derived from original equations describing the activity of
  the different DIVA maps. Synthetic EEG associated with the utterance of syllables
  was generated when both unperturbed and perturbed auditory feedback (first formant
  perturbations) were simulated. The cortical activation maps derived from synthetic
  EEG closely resembled those of the original DIVA model. To validate DIVA_EEG, the
  EEG of individuals with typical voices (N = 30) was acquired during an altered auditory
  feedback paradigm. The resulting empirical brain activity maps significantly overlapped
  with those predicted by DIVA_EEG. In conjunction with other recent model extensions,
  DIVA_EEG lays the foundations for constructing a complete neurocomputational framework
  to tackle vocal and speech disorders, which can guide model-driven personalized
  interventions.
