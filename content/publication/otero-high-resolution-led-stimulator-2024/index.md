abstract: 'Visually evoked steady-state potentials (SSVEPs) are neural responses elicited
  by visual stimuli oscillating at specific frequencies. In this study, we introduce
  a novel LED stimulator system explicitly designed for steady-state visual stimulation,
  offering precise control over visual stimulus parameters, including frequency resolution,
  luminance, and the ability to control the phase at the end of the stimulation. The
  LED stimulator provides a personalized, modular, and affordable option for experimental
  setups. Based on the Teensy 3.2 board, the stimulator utilizes direct digital synthesis
  and pulse width modulation techniques to control the LEDs. We validated its performance
  through four experiments: the first two measured LED light intensities directly,
  while the last two assessed the stimulatortextquoterights impact on EEG recordings.
  The results demonstrate that the stimulator can deliver a stimulus suitable for
  generating SSVEPs with the desired frequency and phase resolution. As an open source
  resource, we provide comprehensive documentation, including all necessary codes
  and electrical diagrams, which facilitates the systemtextquoterights replication
  and adaptation for specific experimental requirements, enhancing its potential for
  widespread use in the field of neuroscience setups.'
