abstract: In the last decade there has been an increase in the use of medical devices
  in the home environment. These devices are commonly the same as those used in hospitals
  by healthcare professionals. The use of these these devices by lay users outside
  of a clinical environment may become unsafe. This study presents a methodology that
  allows decision makers to identify potential risk situations that may arise when
  lay users operate healthcare medical devices at home. Through a usability study
  based on the Grounded Theory methodology, we create a conceptual model in which
  we identified problems and errors related to the use of a multi-parameter monitor
  in a home environment by a group of lay users. The conceptual model is reified as
  a graphical representation, which allows stakeholders to identify (i) the weaknesses
  of the device, (ii) unsafe operation modes, and (iii) the most suitable device for
  a specific user.
