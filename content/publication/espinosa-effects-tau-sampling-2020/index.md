abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide
  clinical information relevant to determine a patienttextquoterights health status.
  The nonlinear analysis of ECG and EEG signals allows for discovering characteristics
  that could not be found with traditional methods based on amplitude and frequency.
  Approximate entropy (ApEn) and sampling entropy (SampEn) are nonlinear data analysis
  algorithms that measure the datatextquoterights regularity, and these are used to
  classify different electrophysiological signals as normal or pathological. Entropy
  calculation requires setting the parameters r (tolerance threshold), m (immersion
  dimension), and $τ$ (time delay), with the last one being related to how the time
  series is downsampled. In this study, we showed the dependence of ApEn and SampEn
  on different values of $τ$, for ECG and EEG signals with different sampling frequencies
  (Fs), extracted from a digital repository. We considered four values of Fs (128,
  256, 384, and 512 Hz for the ECG signals, and 160, 320, 480, and 640 Hz for the
  EEG signals) and five values of $τ$ (from 1 to 5). We performed parametric and nonparametric
  statistical tests to confirm that the groups of normal and pathological ECG and
  EEG signals were significantly different (p textless 0.05) for each F and $τ$ value.
  The separation between the entropy values of regular and irregular signals was variable,
  demonstrating the dependence of ApEn and SampEn with Fs and $τ$. For ECG signals,
  the separation between the conditions was more robust when using SampEn, the lowest
  value of Fs, and $τ$ larger than 1. For EEG signals, the separation between the
  conditions was more robust when using SampEn with large values of Fs and $τ$ larger
  than 1. Therefore, adjusting $τ$ may be convenient for signals that were acquired
  with different Fs to ensure a reliable clinical classification. Furthermore, it
  is useful to set $τ$ to values larger than 1 to reduce the computational cost.
