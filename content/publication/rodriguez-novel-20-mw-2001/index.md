abstract: 'This paper presents a very new drive system used to transport ore from
  the mine down to the concentrator plant in the copper mine Los Pelambres. Eight
  2500 kW motors are driven by three-level inverters with GTOs. A three-level active
  front end (AFE) is used at the input side of each inverter. A GTO chopper is used
  to provide controlled electrical braking in case of line loss. The paper presents
  the requirements and alternatives for the drive system and the control strategies
  for the converters and the belt. A novel application of the selective harmonic elimination
  method is used to reduce the input current harmonics. Special attention is dedicated
  to the interaction with the electrical network. The most relevant features of the
  system are: (i) fuseless operation; (ii) adjustable power factor; (iii) reduced
  input current harmonics; and (iv) smooth transition between motoring and regenerating
  modes and 15 MW of regenerated power with more than six months of successful operation.'
