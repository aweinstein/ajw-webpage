 abstract = {Alzheimer\textquoterights disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia worldwide. Emerging non-invasive treatments such as photobiomodulation target the mitochondria to minimize brain damage, improving cognitive functions. In this work, an experimental design was carried out to evaluate the effect of transcranial light therapy (TLTC) on synaptic plasticity (SP) and cognitive functions in an AD animal model. Twenty-three mice were separated into two general groups: an APP/PS1 (ALZ) transgenic group and a wild-type (WT) group. Each group was randomly subdivided into two subgroups: mice with and without TLTC, depending on whether they would undergo treatment with TLTC. Cognitive function, measured through an object recognition task, showed non-significant improvement after TLTC. SP, on the other hand, was evaluated using four electrophysiological parameters from the Schaffer-CA1 collateral hippocampal synapses: excitatory field potentials (fEPSP), paired pulse facilitation (PPF), long-term depression (LTD), and long-term potentiation (LTP). An improvement was observed in subjects treated with TLTC, showing higher levels of LTP than those transgenic mice that were not exposed to the treatment. Therefore, the results obtained in this work showed that TLTC could be an efficient non-invasive treatment for AD-associated SP deficits.},
