abstract: 'Alzheimertextquoterights disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia worldwide.
  Emerging non-invasive treatments such as photobiomodulation target the mitochondria
  to minimize brain damage, improving cognitive functions. In this work, an experimental
  design was carried out to evaluate the effect of transcranial light therapy (TLTC)
  on synaptic plasticity (SP) and cognitive functions in an AD animal model. Twenty-three
  mice were separated into two general groups: an APP/PS1 (ALZ) transgenic group and
  a wild-type (WT) group. Each group was randomly subdivided into two subgroups: mice
  with and without TLTC, depending on whether they would undergo treatment with TLTC.
  Cognitive function, measured through an object recognition task, showed non-significant
  improvement after TLTC. SP, on the other hand, was evaluated using four electrophysiological
  parameters from the Schaffer-CA1 collateral hippocampal synapses: excitatory field
  potentials (fEPSP), paired pulse facilitation (PPF), long-term depression (LTD),
  and long-term potentiation (LTP). An improvement was observed in subjects treated
  with TLTC, showing higher levels of LTP than those transgenic mice that were not
  exposed to the treatment. Therefore, the results obtained in this work showed that
  TLTC could be an efficient non-invasive treatment for AD-associated SP deficits.'
