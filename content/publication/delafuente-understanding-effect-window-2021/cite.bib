 abstract = {The Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT) is a helpful tool to identify muscle fatigue with clinical and sports applications. However, the choice of STFT parameters may affect the estimation of myoelectrical manifestations of fatigue. Here, we determine the effect of window length and overlap selections on the frequency slope and the coefficient of variation from EMG spectrum features in fatiguing contractions. We also determine whether STFT parameters affect the relationship between frequency slopes and task failure. Eighty-eight healthy adult men performed one-leg heel-rise until exhaustion. A factorial design with a window length of 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000~ms with 0, 25, 50, 75, and 90% of overlap was used. The frequency slope was non-linearly fitted as a task failure function, followed by a dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis. The STFT parameters elicited five patterns. A small window length produced a higher slope frequency for the peak frequency (p~\textless~0.001). The contrary was found for the mean and median frequency (p~\textless~0.001). A larger window length elicited a higher slope frequency for the mean and peak frequencies. The largest frequency slope and dispersion was found for a window length of 50~ms without overlap using peak frequency. A combination of 250~ms with 50% of overlap reduced the dispersion both for peak, median, and mean frequency, but decreased the slope frequency. Therefore, the selection of STFT parameters during dynamic contractions should be accompanied by a mechanical measure of the task failure, and its parameters should be adjusted according to the experiment\textquoterights requirements.},
