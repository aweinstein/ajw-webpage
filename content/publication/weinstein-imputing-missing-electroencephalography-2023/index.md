abstract: Graph Signal Processing (GSP) is a framework for analyzing signals defined
  over a graph. Considering the electrodes used to record the electroencephalogram
  (EEG) as a sensor network makes it possible to use GSP to analyze EEG signals. Using
  the graph over which the signal is defined allows one to take advantage of a signal
  structure that is ignored by classic signal processing approaches. However, there
  are many details about how to use GSP to analyze the EEG that are not studied in
  the literature. Here we show an example of how to impute missing EEG data using
  GSP. We show that GSP allows reconstructing EEG missing data with a lower error
  than a classic approach based on radial basis functions, confirming that the underlying
  graph over a graph over which the signal is defined contains relevant information
  that can be exploited to improve a given signal processing task. By studying two
  approaches for building the graph (k-nearest neighbors and a thresholded Gaussian
  kernel) and the effect of its parameter, we highlight the importance of building
  the graph appropriately. These results show the potential of incorporating GPS techniques
  into the EEG processing pipeline.
