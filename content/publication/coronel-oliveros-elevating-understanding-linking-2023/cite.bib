 abstract = {High-altitude hypoxia triggers brain function changes reminiscent of those in healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease, compromising cognition and
executive functions. Our study sought to validate high-altitude hypoxia as a
model for assessing brain activity disruptions akin to aging. We collected EEG
data from sixteen healthy volunteers during acute high-altitude hypoxia (at 4000
masl) and at sea-level, focusing on relative changes in power and aperiodic
slope of the EEG spectrum due to hypoxia. Additionally, we examined functional
connectivity using wPLI, and functional segregation and integration in using
graph theory tools. High altitude led to slower brain oscillations, i.e.,
increased $δ$ and reduced $α$ power, and flattened the 1/f aperiodic
slope, indicating higher electrophysiological noise, akin to healthy aging.
Notably, functional integration strengthened in the $þeta$ band, exhibiting
unique topographical patterns at the subnetwork level, including increased
frontocentral and reduced occipitoparietal integration. Moreover, we discovered
significant correlations between subjects' age, 1/f slope, $þeta$ band
integration, and observed robust effects of hypoxia after adjusting for age. Our
findings shed light on how reduced oxygen levels at high-altitudes influence
brain activity patterns resembling those in neurodegenerative disorders and
aging, making high-altitude hypoxia a promising model for comprehending the
brain in health and disease.},
