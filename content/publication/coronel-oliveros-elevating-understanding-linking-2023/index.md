abstract: High-altitude hypoxia triggers brain function changes reminiscent of those
  in healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease, compromising cognition and executive functions.
  Our study sought to validate high-altitude hypoxia as a model for assessing brain
  activity disruptions akin to aging. We collected EEG data from sixteen healthy volunteers
  during acute high-altitude hypoxia (at 4000 masl) and at sea-level, focusing on
  relative changes in power and aperiodic slope of the EEG spectrum due to hypoxia.
  Additionally, we examined functional connectivity using wPLI, and functional segregation
  and integration in using graph theory tools. High altitude led to slower brain oscillations,
  i.e., increased $δ$ and reduced $α$ power, and flattened the 1/f aperiodic slope,
  indicating higher electrophysiological noise, akin to healthy aging. Notably, functional
  integration strengthened in the $þeta$ band, exhibiting unique topographical patterns
  at the subnetwork level, including increased frontocentral and reduced occipitoparietal
  integration. Moreover, we discovered significant correlations between subjects'
  age, 1/f slope, $þeta$ band integration, and observed robust effects of hypoxia
  after adjusting for age. Our findings shed light on how reduced oxygen levels at
  high-altitudes influence brain activity patterns resembling those in neurodegenerative
  disorders and aging, making high-altitude hypoxia a promising model for comprehending
  the brain in health and disease.
