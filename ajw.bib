	abstract = {The amplitude of auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) generated in the brainstem of rats exponentially decreases over the sequential averaging of EEG epochs. This behavior is partially due to the adaptation of the ASSR induced by the continuous and monotonous stimulation. In this study, we analyzed the potential clinical relevance of the ASSR adaptation. ASSR were elicited in eight anesthetized adult rats by 8-kHz tones, modulated in amplitude at 115 Hz. We called independent epochs to those EEG epochs acquired with sufficiently long inter-stimulus interval, so the ASSR contained in any given epoch is not affected by the previous stimulation. We tested whether the detection of ASSRs is improved when the response is computed by averaging independent EEG epochs, containing only unadapted auditory responses. The improvements in the ASSR detection obtained with standard, weighted and sorted averaging were compared. In the absence of artifacts, when the ASSR was elicited by continuous acoustic stimulation, the computation of the ASSR amplitude relied upon the averaging method. While the adaptive behavior of the ASSR was still evident after the weighting of epochs, the sorted averaging resulted in under-estimations of the ASSR amplitude. In the absence of artifacts, the ASSR amplitudes computed by averaging independent epochs did not depend on the averaging procedure. Averaging independent epochs resulted in higher ASSR amplitudes and halved the number of EEG epochs needed to be acquired to achieve the maximum detection rate of the ASSR. Acquisition protocols based on averaging independent EEG epochs, in combination with appropriate averaging methods for artifact reduction might contribute to develop more accurate hearing assessments based on ASSRs.},

While the development of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) has led to significant achievements, as typified by recent grand challenge events, to date the UGV equivalent of the UAV autopilot is not available. In this paper we describe our recent research aimed at the development of a generic UGV autopilot. Assuming we are given a drive-by-wire vehicle that accepts as inputs steering, brake, and throttle commands, we present a system that adds sonar ranging sensors, GPS/IMU/odometry, stereo camera, and scanning laser sensors, together with a variety of interfacing and communication hardware. The system also includes a finite state machine-based software architecture as well as a graphical user interface for the operator control unit (OCU). Algorithms are presented that enable an end-to-end scenario whereby an operator can view stereo images as seen by the vehicle and can input GPS waypoints either from a map or in the vehicle's scene-view image, at which point the system uses the environmental sensors as inputs to a Kalman filter for pose estimation and then computes control actions to move through the waypoint list, while avoiding obstacles. The long-term goal of the research is a system that is generically applicable to any drive-by-wire unmanned ground vehicle.},

The LED stimulator provides a personalized, modular, and affordable option for experimental setups.

We validated its performance through four experiments: the first two measured LED light intensities directly, while the last two assessed the stimulator{\textquoteright}s impact on EEG recordings. The results demonstrate that the stimulator can deliver a stimulus suitable for generating SSVEPs with the desired frequency and phase resolution.

Emerging non-invasive treatments such as photobiomodulation target the mitochondria to minimize brain damage, improving cognitive functions. In this work, an experimental design was carried out to evaluate the effect of transcranial light therapy (TLTC) on synaptic plasticity (SP) and cognitive functions in an AD animal model. Twenty-three mice were separated into two general groups: an APP/PS1 (ALZ) transgenic group and a wild-type (WT) group. Each group was randomly subdivided into two subgroups: mice with and without TLTC, depending on whether they would undergo treatment with TLTC. Cognitive function, measured through an object recognition task, showed non-significant improvement after TLTC. SP, on the other hand, was evaluated using four electrophysiological parameters from the Schaffer-CA1 collateral hippocampal synapses: excitatory field potentials (fEPSP), paired pulse facilitation (PPF), long-term depression (LTD), and long-term potentiation (LTP). An improvement was observed in subjects treated with TLTC, showing higher levels of LTP than those transgenic mice that were not exposed to the treatment. Therefore, the results obtained in this work showed that TLTC could be an efficient non-invasive treatment for AD-associated SP deficits.},

Human gait was recorded on a treadmill at 2.5 km/h. This task was recorded with a 3D motion system synchronized with electromyographic (sEMG) equipment. The sEMG signals were acquired from three portions of the triceps surae (soleus [So], medial [MG], and lateral [LG] gastrocnemius) and tibialis anterior [TA], in both shanks. The mCoA levels (represented as a percentage) were calculated considering twenty gait cycles in muscular pairs TA-MG, TA-LG, and TA-So, in both operated (OL) and non-operated (NOL) limbs. The analysis was estimated with a processing pipeline developed in Python language, considering the Falcone and Winter equation. The results showed a slight increase in the mCoA during gait in some muscular pairs at 24 weeks. The coactivation levels were greater in the TA-MG and TA-So pairs of the OL vs the NOL. Additionally, a higher asymmetry was observed between OL vs NOL at the 12 weeks.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide clinical information relevant to determine a patient{\textquoteright}s health status. The nonlinear analysis of ECG and EEG signals allows for discovering characteristics that could not be found with traditional methods based on amplitude and frequency. Approximate entropy (ApEn) and sampling entropy (SampEn) are nonlinear data analysis algorithms that measure the data{\textquoteright}s regularity, and these are used to classify different electrophysiological signals as normal or pathological. Entropy calculation requires setting the parameters r (tolerance threshold), m (immersion dimension), and $\tau$ (time delay), with the last one being related to how the time series is downsampled. In this study, we showed the dependence of ApEn and SampEn on different values of $\tau$, for ECG and EEG signals with different sampling frequencies (Fs), extracted from a digital repository. We considered four values of Fs (128, 256, 384, and 512 Hz for the ECG signals, and 160, 320, 480, and 640 Hz for the EEG signals) and five values of $\tau$ (from 1 to 5). We performed parametric and nonparametric statistical tests to confirm that the groups of normal and pathological ECG and EEG signals were significantly different (p {\textless} 0.05) for each F and $\tau$ value. The separation between the entropy values of regular and irregular signals was variable, demonstrating the dependence of ApEn and SampEn with Fs and $\tau$. For ECG signals, the separation between the conditions was more robust when using SampEn, the lowest value of Fs, and $\tau$ larger than 1. For EEG signals, the separation between the conditions was more robust when using SampEn with large values of Fs and $\tau$ larger than 1. Therefore, adjusting $\tau$ may be convenient for signals that were acquired with different Fs to ensure a reliable clinical classification. Furthermore, it is useful to set $\tau$ to values larger than 1 to reduce the computational cost.},

	abstract = {The Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT) is a helpful tool to identify muscle fatigue with clinical and sports applications. However, the choice of STFT parameters may affect the estimation of myoelectrical manifestations of fatigue. Here, we determine the effect of window length and overlap selections on the frequency slope and the coefficient of variation from EMG spectrum features in fatiguing contractions. We also determine whether STFT parameters affect the relationship between frequency slopes and task failure. Eighty-eight healthy adult men performed one-leg heel-rise until exhaustion. A factorial design with a window length of 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000~ms with 0, 25, 50, 75, and 90\% of overlap was used. The frequency slope was non-linearly fitted as a task failure function, followed by a dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis. The STFT parameters elicited five patterns. A small window length produced a higher slope frequency for the peak frequency (p~{\textless}~0.001). The contrary was found for the mean and median frequency (p~{\textless}~0.001). A larger window length elicited a higher slope frequency for the mean and peak frequencies. The largest frequency slope and dispersion was found for a window length of 50~ms without overlap using peak frequency. A combination of 250~ms with 50\% of overlap reduced the dispersion both for peak, median, and mean frequency, but decreased the slope frequency. Therefore, the selection of STFT parameters during dynamic contractions should be accompanied by a mechanical measure of the task failure, and its parameters should be adjusted according to the experiment{\textquoteright}s requirements.},

	abstract = {Subglottal Impedance-Based Inverse Filtering (IBIF) allows for the continuous, non-invasive estimation of glottal airflow from a surface accelerometer placed over the anterior neck skin below the larynx. It has been shown to be advantageous for the ambulatory monitoring of vocal function, specifically in the use of high-order statistics to understand long-term vocal behavior. However, during long-term ambulatory recordings over several days, conditions may drift from the laboratory environment where the IBIF parameters were initially estimated due to sensor positioning, skin attachment, or temperature, among other factors. Observation uncertainties and model mismatch may result in significant deviations in the glottal airflow estimates; unfortunately, they are very difficult to quantify in ambulatory conditions due to a lack of a reference signal. To address this issue, we propose a Kalman filter implementation of the IBIF filter, which allows for both estimating the model uncertainty and adapting the airflow estimates to correct for signal deviations. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) results from laboratory experiments using the Rainbow Passage indicate an improvement using the modified Kalman filter on amplitude-based measures for phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction (PVH) subjects compared to the standard IBIF; the latter showing a statistically difference (p-value =0.02, F=4.1) with respect to a reference glottal volume velocity signal estimated from a single notch filter used here as ground-truth in this work. In contrast, maximum flow declination rates from subjects with vocal phonotrauma exhibit a small but statistically difference between the ground-truth signal and the modified Kalman filter when using one-way ANOVA (p-value =0.04, F=3.3). Other measures did not have significant differences with either the modified Kalman filter or IBIF compared to ground-truth, with the exception of H1-H2, whose performance deteriorates for both methods. Overall, both methods (modified Kalman filter and IBIF) show similar glottal airflow measures, with the advantage of the modified Kalman filter to improve amplitude estimation. Moreover, Kalman filter deviations from the IBIF output airflow might suggest a better representation of some fine details in the ground-truth glottal airflow signal. Other applications may take more advantage from the adaptation offered by the modified Kalman filter implementation.},

However, few studies have evaluated temporal changes in the electromyographic activity (EMG) of lower limb muscles during running. The aim of this study was to compare temporal changes in EMG amplitude between RF and FF running techniques. Eleven recreational runners ran on a treadmill at a self-selected speed, once using a RF strike pattern and once using a FF strike pattern (randomized order). The EMG of five lower limb muscles [rectus femoris (RFe), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), medial and lateral gastrocnemius (MG and LG)] was evaluated, using bipolar electrodes. EMG data from the RF and FF running techniques was then processed and compared with statistical parametric mapping (SPM), dividing the analysis of the running cycle into stance and swing phases. The MG and LG muscles showed higher activation during FF running at the beginning of the stance phase and at the end of the swing phase. During the end of the swing phase, the TA muscle's EMG amplitude was higher, when the RF running technique was used. A higher level of co-activation between the gastrocnemius and TA muscles was observed in both stance and swing phases using RF. The myoelectric behaviour of the RFe and BF muscles was similar during both running techniques. The current findings highlight that the two running techniques predominately reflect adjustments of the shank and not the thigh muscles, in both phases of the running cycle. HighlightsStatistical parametric mapping (SPM) can reveal temporal differences in muscle activity between running techniques.The medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles were more active at specific time-instants of the initial stance and late swing phases during forefoot (FF) running compared to rearfoot (RF) running.Higher activation was observed for the tibialis anterior muscle at the end of the swing phase during RF runningContrary to the muscle activity differences observed in the leg muscles, the muscle activity of the thigh muscles was similar during RF and FF running.},

Considering the electrodes used to record the electroencephalogram (EEG) as a sensor network makes it possible to use GSP to analyze EEG signals. Using the graph over which the signal is defined allows one to take advantage of a signal structure that is ignored by classic signal processing approaches. However, there are many details about how to use GSP to analyze the EEG that are not studied in the literature. Here we show an example of how to impute missing EEG data using GSP. We show that GSP allows reconstructing EEG missing data with a lower error than a classic approach based on radial basis functions, confirming that the underlying graph over a graph over which the signal is defined contains relevant information that can be exploited to improve a given signal processing task. By studying two approaches for building the graph (k-nearest neighbors and a thresholded Gaussian kernel) and the effect of its parameter, we highlight the importance of building the graph appropriately. These results show the potential of incorporating GPS techniques into the EEG processing pipeline.},

Here, we described the effect of instantaneous spatial representation (sEMG segmentation) on embedded fuzzy topological polyhedrons and image features extracted from sEMG activation maps. We analyzed 73,008 topographic sEMG activation maps from seven healthy participants (age 21.4 {\textpm} 1.5 years and body mass 74.5 {\textpm} 8.5~kg) who performed submaximal isometric plantar flexions with 64 surface electrodes placed over the medial gastrocnemius muscle. Window lengths of 50, 100, 150, 250, 500, and 1,000~ms and overlap of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 90\% to change sEMG map generation were tested in a factorial design (grid search). The Shannon entropy and volume of global embedded tri-dimensional geometries (polyhedron projections), and the Shannon entropy, location of the center (LoC), and image moments of maps were analyzed. The polyhedron volume increased when the overlap was {\textless}25\% and {\textgreater}75\%. Entropy decreased when the overlap was {\textless}25\% and {\textgreater}75\% and when the window length was {\textless}100~ms and {\textgreater}500~ms. The LoC in the x-axis, entropy, and the histogram moments of maps showed effects for overlap (p {\textless} 0.001), while the LoC in the y-axis and entropy showed effects for both overlap and window length (p {\textless} 0.001). In conclusion, the instantaneous sEMG maps are first affected by outer parameters of the overlap, followed by the length of the window. Thus, choosing the window length and overlap parameters can introduce bias in sEMG activation maps, resulting in distorted regional muscle activation.},

This study introduces DIVA\_EEG an extension of DIVA that utilizes electroencephalography (EEG) to leverage the high temporal resolution and broad availability of EEG over fMRI. For the development of DIVA\_EEG, EEG-like signals were derived from original equations describing the activity of the different DIVA maps. Synthetic EEG associated with the utterance of syllables was generated when both unperturbed and perturbed auditory feedback (first formant perturbations) were simulated. The cortical activation maps derived from synthetic EEG closely resembled those of the original DIVA model. To validate DIVA\_EEG, the EEG of individuals with typical voices (N = 30) was acquired during an altered auditory feedback paradigm. The resulting empirical brain activity maps significantly overlapped with those predicted by DIVA\_EEG. In conjunction with other recent model extensions, DIVA\_EEG lays the foundations for constructing a complete neurocomputational framework to tackle vocal and speech disorders, which can guide model-driven personalized interventions.},

data from sixteen healthy volunteers during acute high-altitude hypoxia (at 4000
masl) and at sea-level, focusing on relative changes in power and aperiodic
slope of the EEG spectrum due to hypoxia. Additionally, we examined functional
connectivity using wPLI, and functional segregation and integration in using
graph theory tools. High altitude led to slower brain oscillations, i.e.,
increased $\delta$ and reduced $\alpha$ power, and flattened the 1/f aperiodic
slope, indicating higher electrophysiological noise, akin to healthy aging.
Notably, functional integration strengthened in the $\theta$ band, exhibiting
unique topographical patterns at the subnetwork level, including increased
frontocentral and reduced occipitoparietal integration. Moreover, we discovered
significant correlations between subjects' age, 1/f slope, $\theta$ band
integration, and observed robust effects of hypoxia after adjusting for age. Our
findings shed light on how reduced oxygen levels at high-altitudes influence
brain activity patterns resembling those in neurodegenerative disorders and

We simulated this model for 30 min to generate multi-state metastability. We identified global coupling and delay parameters that maximize spectral entropy, a proxy for multi-state metastability. At this operational point, multiple frequency-specific coherent sub-networks spontaneously emerge across oscillatory modes, persisting for periods between 140 and 4300 ms, reflecting flexible and sustained dynamic states. The topography of these sub-networks aligns with empirical resting-state neuroimaging data. Additionally, periodic components of the EEG spectra from young healthy participants correlate with maximal multi-state metastability, while dynamics away from this point correlate with sleep and anesthesia spectra. Our findings suggest that multi-state metastable functional dynamics observed in empirical data emerge from specific interactions of structural topography and connection delays, providing a platform to study mechanisms underlying flexible dynamics of cognition.},
